\f0\fs24 \cf0 h3 had no padding, putting padding on it got rid of the space between the nav bar and the mainCenterColumn. Now that is kludgy, so then I got rid of that and played around with the mainCenterColumn padding-top, and set it to 1. Problem solved. If you set this to 0, mainCenterColumn will just fill around the text of the inside. If that first inside thing has no padding, the html is laid out such that each newline has a space between the previous. So the h3 had a huge newline space I guess and so the outer div was wrapping tight to the start of h3 rather than the newline space that\'92s involved. So setting the padding-top to 1 then tells mainCenterColumn that yes I am setting the top, 0 is kind of like a null variable here.}
