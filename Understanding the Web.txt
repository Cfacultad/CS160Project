This will be a rundown of how everything works. I will try to make things as unambiguous and thorough as possible. I will try to emphasize things in layman’s terms and go into depth were need be.

First thing to say is that besides this document, you will want help from online. And I can think of only a few other places that come close to having such a vast amount of information on web programming. If you want help with AngularJS, just do a Google search of AngularJS w3schools. If you want CSS help just do a Google search of CSS w3schools. Do the same for JavaScript, MySQL, Bootstrap, HTML, PHP, and jQuery. The w3 in the name is derived from World Wide Web.

Here is the structure of how web requests and responses work:
When you visit amazon.com for example, you are viewing their website on a browser. That browser runs/interprets all the javascript and puts the html and css where it is told to so that the end result is amazon’s webpage. Please have a look at: 
	http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/howbrowserswork1.htm
The webpage could be a single page application or a multipage application, or a hybrid of both. Single page means that all the web pages of site such as amazon.com are loaded initially such that if you go to another page within amazon such as their check out page, rather than sending a request to the server/backend for that page, the browser would have already loaded this page and kept it “hidden” in the background. Why is this good? Because instead of waiting for both the response from the server and the loading of the content resulting in a flicker or a white page for a second or two (or however long it takes for all the content to completely load), the transition from one page to the next within the same site is continuous rather than choppy. A single page application would have that page with all that large amount of data already loaded initially hidden in the background until it is told to become visible by the browser resulting in a smooth and continuous flow from one web page to the next within the same website. How do single page applications do this magic? It is with the help of the ‘#’ symbol in the url. Take a look at this example:
	
	Normal url used in multipage applications:
	www.example.com/about
	
	Hash-based url used in single page applications:
	www.example.com/#/about

	Hashbang-based url also used in new versions of single page applications:
	www.example.com/#!/about

These urls are either hash-based urls (/#/) or hashbang-based urls (/#!/), compared to the normal urls we are used to seeing. Here is a good read for exactly what goes on, please read at least half of it, it is 100% relevant even though we aren’t using React:
	http://singlepageapplication.com/react-app-url-schemes-part-1/
  
Another good read is:
	https://neoteric.eu/single-page-application-vs-multiple-page-application

Now that you understand SPA vs MPA (single page application vs multipage application), 
lets move onto what a web server is.

All websites are run on a computer, that computer we call a web server or server for short. Any computer can be used as a web server. Even your computer that you are reading this on can be used as a web server as long as it is a MAC, Linux based, or Windows computer. You have to download Apache or any other server and you have to see if there is a version of Apache for your computer. More on this later. The reason you would not want to run a website on your personal computer is because in order for your website to be up and running 24/7, you would have to have your computer on and staying at home 24/7. This is because it has to stay connected with the public IP address that your home modem was assigned by Comcast or AT&T or whoever your service provider is. Therefore it is better to use a separate computer for this, one that has none of your personal data on it, and that does not have a screen/GUI since that takes up a lot of energy and ends up costing you a lot more in the long run. An example of a simple server would be a Raspberry Pi. It has no GUI and is really cheap ($80). In order to run this server from your home you must do a thing called port forwarding. You port forward port 80 of your computer to your wifi router (not your modem but your router). Look this up if you are interested, but it is somewhat irrelevant in terms of this project.

Before I talk about Apache and PHP, I must re-emphasize one quick thing that I mentioned first in this document about the front end and what a browser is. A browser such as Chrome or Safari or Firefox, you can think of it as an interpreter that only understands JavaScript, in fact that is basically what it is. Amazon.com is requested by the user, and the response from Amazon’s server is a bunch of JavaScript that must be interpreted and ran, and well this is what the browser is for — it runs the JavaScript code that was sent from the backend/server, and this JavaScript code is what we call the frontend code of the website. Of course the browser understands HTML and CSS too.

Now onto what Apache is on the back end and what PHP or any scripting language Apache recognizes allows for us to do.

Apache handles the networking side of everything. Apache is not the only type of server out there, here is a wiki on all the servers out there: 
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_server_software
But we programmers do not worry about Apache or the actual server program for it is only a listener that listens for requests and pipes (don’t fully know what pipe means) the sections of this requests into PHP data structures for us backend programmers to use with ease (for example you want to get the host in the request? Use this in PHP: $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']). And when the backend sends the response, Apache takes what is to be sent back to the client and sends it in the correct way. This is where http (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) comes into play. Browsers and Apache must have a protocol to send all this information, and they send it via HTTP. Here is an example HTTP:

Client/Browser Request
	GET /docs/index.html HTTP/1.1
	Host: www.nowhere123.com
	Accept: image/gif, image/jpeg, */*
	Accept-Language: en-us
	Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
	User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
	(blank line)

Server Response
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Date: Sun, 18 Oct 2009 08:56:53 GMT
	Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
	Last-Modified: Sat, 20 Nov 2004 07:16:26 GMT
	ETag: "10000000565a5-2c-3e94b66c2e680"
	Accept-Ranges: bytes
	Content-Length: 44
	Connection: close
	Content-Type: text/html
	X-Pad: avoid browser bug
  
	<html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>

So a request from the client or a response from the server must be put into this layout in order for the browser or Apache to be able to read it and make sense of it. The client can make I believe up to 7 types of requests and they are: GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, CONNECT. The only two that we will really ever work with are GET and POST. In fact, I have never used any of the others, I can’t say I have done a whole lot of web programming, but I’ve done enough to say that the other 5 just aren’t used all that much. A link to read more on this is: 
	https://www.w3schools.com/TagS/ref_httpmethods.asp
Which brings me to re-emphasize: w3schools is the place to get all the information you could ever ask for when it comes to web programming. They describe things simply and in ways that are easy to understand. They even provide samples for you to run and see what they just taught you in action. Please see up top for more about w3schools.com. 

So how are these requests and responses sent to the correct location? It is done so by public IP addresses. There are private ip addresses and that is for all devices that belong to a single public ip address, and this is why you must port forward if you want to run server from home, you must port forward your private port 80 to public port of your public ip address via your router. Anyways, there are two types of public ip addresses: static and dynamic. Static ip address for example 20.40.153.12 will always stay the same. Dynamic ip address will switch out one ip for another and will do so randomly. Most always your home ip address will be a dynamic ip, and most always a web server will belong to a static ip address. This is where running a server from your home can be a problem. You assign your domain name say www.basschimes.com. Well in a month or maybe in only a few days, your home modem will be assigned a different ip address and now your www.basschimes.com is pointing to some other dynamic ip address. It will never point to Google’s ip address for example because most likely Google used a static ip address. To go to google you can type in 
	http://172.217.6.78
This will take you to goole. This is because there are DNS Servers that take the DNS google.com and see that it is associated with the address of 172.217.6.78. Then it now knows what place to go to. The “host” in this request still stays “google.com” even though it is now 172.217.6.78. This is important because if you want to run multiple websites from your computer at home, all you have to do is check whether the host is basechimes.com or adamhomann.com (let’s say you own both those domain names) and handle the request accordingly using a simple PHP if statement
	if (strpos($host, 'adamhomann.com') !== false) {
		require_once “./adamhomann_website/index.php";
	}
	else {
		require_once “./basschimes_website/index.php";
	}

Now there is a special kind of DNS that can point to a dynamic ip address, and these are called Dynamic Domain Name System or Dynamic DNS or DDNS for short. But it isn’t always possible to point a DDNS to a DNS. No-ip is a company that allows you to make a DDNS. Now hosting companies such as 1&1 and GoDaddy.com might not let you connect your host name with your DDNS name. I know for sure 1&1 does not let you do this, and so I have to point adamhomann.com to my dynamic ip address rather than my DDNS which is
	http://homann.mynetgear.com
So when my dynamic ip address is switched for another, my site will crash, and so I have to always be ready for that crash. I am currently having to figure out how I can change this.

Now you know about IP addresses, browsers and what they do, http requests and responses, w3shools, apache, port forwarding, DNS, DDNS, DNS Servers, single page applications vs multipage applications (SPA vs MPA). Let’s move onto a few last things before I get to the code. Let’s talk about URLs and GET vs POST requests and what and AJAX request is.
So a URL is a path through the folder structure, but a URL that looks like this
	www.adamhomann.com/about
is much cleaner than
	www.adamhomann.com/src/views/about.php
So we use something called the .htaccess file located in the root directory of our website to alias from the long URL to a short URL. Also, the .htaccess file allows for any unknown request such as www.adamhomann.com/junkandnonsense41234 or www.adamhomann.com/qpwonwel23423ksafn that would give a 404 error to send the user instead of the 404 error, they are sent to the home page using this:
	ErrorDocument 404 /index.php
where within the index.php file you have an if else statement, where the else is for all unknown requests and so therefore do this:
	header("Location: /");
where hopefully one of your if else statements before the else is:
	if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] == '/') {
		send home page
	}

You can use the .htaccess file for other things such as preventing a file type from being viewable from the client side. So if you have a txt document or a config file that contains important information for only the server side, then you might want to consider moving outside the root directory or if that is not an option, then you can use the .htaccess file to deny access to it from the client side.

Now you can do either a GET request or a POST request, a GET request requests data from the server, and a POST request submits data to the server. When you want to “get” another page, you use GET, but his refreshes the page unless you use the ‘#’ as mentioned above with SPA. Anyways, you can include variables in this GET request, but since this is a URL, all these variable are shown. An example of this is:
	https://www.fandango.com/transaction/ticketing/redvines/ticketboxoffice.aspx?row_count=2553707866&mid=145763&tid=AAUJF&wssaffid=11836&wssac=123
Where everything after the question mark are variables. This is not good for sending information that you wish to keep safe and secure since the data is in the URL request itself. So you can use a POST to send the data to the server with more security, but of course there is still much to do. There is one pattern called the POST-Redirect_GET pattern which allows users to send the data, and then a redirect is called with a GET request so that a form cannot be resubmitted in error. Look this up if you are part of the back end or are interested, it is incredibly important:
	https://en.ryte.com/wiki/Post-Redirect-Get
Especially if you are doing the backend, the PRG pattern will be useful for making transactions.

JSON vs XML. I do not fully understand XML and so I will let you figure that out, but it is basically a way for you to make your own version of HTML tags. So instead of <div> you can do <adam> or something like that. JSON is where it’s at. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. An example of JSON is:

        {
            "title": "Person",
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "firstName": {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "lastName": {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "age": {
                    "description": "Age in years",
                    "type": "integer",
                    "minimum": 0
                }
            },
            "required": ["firstName", "lastName"]
        }






Lets move on to folder structure and types of files you will see and what those files do.

In the root directory of CS160Project, you’ll see there is a hidden file (file containing only the extension) called “.htaccess” and this file is closely tied with Apache so don’t worry too much about it, but I had to create this file and put the code in there. This file allows for url aliasing, and also handles 404 (Page not found) errors by taking them and rerouting them to home. So for example, lets say someone writes in organicfoodstore.com/about, we want it to go to the about page. Lets say though that the user slips and types in organicfoodstore.com/whljsun… this would result in a 404 page not found error, which means we should reroute it and any non existing requested page to home. The .htaccess file does this. By the way, when you do this in the future on your own web server, you will have to not only create the .htaccess file, but also allow for RewriteEngine on by going into Apache config and entering about 4 lines of code. Here is a web page talking about this for MAMP, on Linux machines such as my Raspberry Pi I think the conf file was elsewhere so definitely do a quick search such as “MAMP OS X mod rewrite .htaccess file”, or “MAMP Linux mod rewrite .htaccess file”, or “Apache Linux mod rewrite .htaccess file” but here is the idea of what you need to do:
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7670561/how-to-get-htaccess-to-work-on-mamp
again its only a few lines of code, but it is crucial.

Ok so you see an index.php file. This is where we check to see which url was entered. The request goes through our .htaccess file first, and then goes to index.php. Then the correct instance is made in the index.php by making a controller object, which then creates a model and view object. This is then sent to the front end with all the correct files which is then interpreted by the browser that the client is using.

If you have a look in the src folder, you will see there are seven folders: 
	1) configs (where our database “config” and “make” file will be) 
	2) controllers (where our back end controllers will be)
	3) css (gets sent to the front end, this file contains a css file for general purposes as well as a css file for overwriting bootstrap styling. We will try to use Angular styling as much as possible for now, but if needs be we can always do css stuff here)
	4) js (all our javascript files that contain our app.php notice it is a php file and not a js, this is because we pass in our php data from our database in this file! Also, you notice that it is where we set up the angular global app variable which allows for the whole angular system to work and for our single page application page routes. So this is a very important page. Also within this folder are two folders, partials and front end Angular Controllers. The html files for each page of the single page application are in partials folder.)
	5) models (back end database connection to MySQL)
	6) pics (where we will store any pictures for our website)
	7) views (where our back end initiates a view. Yes, most views will be all done from the frontend, but the backend might have times where it needs to send views that are not part of our single page application, and this is where you would put those views. For example the post redirect get patter, I believe this folder will be good for that redirect, or maybe not but its up to you guys.)


Now let me give you some examples of how to code in this project. Let’s say you want to add an AngularJS controller called CheckOutController.js. You would do so by first making a js file in the src/js/controllers folder and call it CheckOutController. Then you need to go to src/views/view.php and towards the bottom you will add another 
	<script src="/src/js/controllers/CheckOutController.js"></script>
And then finally make sure you attach your controller to a view/route, and you do so by two ways: on the app.php page you can add a controller by doing the following:
	
	.when("/checkOut", {
        	templateUrl : "src/js/partials/checkOut.html",
        	controller : "CheckOutController"
    	})

and the other way of adding a controller is doing this in a div:
	<div ng-controller=‘CheckOutController’>
		
Notice that in the app.js, I gave my app the name ‘myApp’. So you connect the html up to the AngularJS app by doing the following in a div or even the <body> tag:
	<body ng-app='myApp' ng-controller='MainController' ng-style="backgroundStyle" ng-cloak>

Now you can add a controller on the same line, but not outside of this tag, that would result in an error. The ng-style written in the same controller can be applied to the same line as well. ng-cloak supposedly prevents flicker while the html is being loaded.



talk about JSON vs XML

Talk about using an API and how the client cannot make a request from outside the server, otherwise it will result in a Cross-Site Request access denied due to Same Origin Policy.
